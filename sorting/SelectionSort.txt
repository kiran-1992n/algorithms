Time Complexity: O(n^2) as there are two nested loops
Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n^2).


Auxiliary Space: O(1)--> Constant Space


The good thing about selection sort is it never makes more than O(n) swaps and
can be useful when memory write is a costly operation.


Stability : The default implementation is not stable.
However it can be made stable.


In Place : Yes, it does not require extra space.
